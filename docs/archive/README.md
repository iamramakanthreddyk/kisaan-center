# Archived documents

This folder contains documentation that was archived as part of a cleanup step on 2025-10-16.

Files archived (previous locations):

- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`
- `docs/KisaanCenter_Master_Documentation.md`
- `docs/improvemnts.md` (misspelled, deprecated)
- `docs/REAL_API_TEST_FIXES.md`
- `docs/OWNER_MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`

Rationale:

- These documents were marked as deprecated in `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` and had clear banners marking them as historical snapshots. They were archived to reduce clutter while preserving historical context for audits.

If you need any of the archived files restored, they are preserved in Git history and can be recovered with `git checkout`.
